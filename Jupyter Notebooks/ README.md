The Jupyter Notebookes that were created first are extensively described here.  
- Preprocess data from poly Dataset.ipynb : Processes images from the poly Dataset to be in the appropriate form to be fed into the network.
- CNN Build and train.ipynb : Contains all code to create the CNN architecture and train the model.
- Fingernet.ipynb : Image processing and CNN.
- ROI.ipynb : Code cells to find the Region of interest in a finger image.
- Fingerprint_Minutiae_Extraction.ipynb : Code for matching two fingerprint images based on the number of matched Minutiae points.
- Result Evaluation and Display.ipynb : Test the two different methods of matching on the test images and on my own images. The two last cells also display the process of the image transformation to the appropriate form.
